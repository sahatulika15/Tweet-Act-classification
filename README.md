**Paper Name:-** Tweet Act Classification : A Deep Learning based Classifier for Recognizing Speech Acts in Twitter
> Speech act provides valuable insight for understanding the communicative intention and behaviour of a user utterance. This applies for conversation on any platform which includes social media network such as Twitter. This paper presents a deep learning based tweet act classifier (speech acts for Twitter) for understanding the content and intention of tweets and for discovering the valuable communications amongst the tweeters. A generic taxonomy of seven speech acts has been created for the task followed by a dataset annotated with these tweet acts. A Convolution Neural Network (CNN) based Deep Learning (DL) architecture is integrated with different classifiers at the final layer such as softmax or linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to develop a tweet act classifier. To make the classifier even more robust, various hand-crafted features are added to the system to boost its effectiveness towards improving the performance of the system.
